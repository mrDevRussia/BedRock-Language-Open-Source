1. If you have NASM use it to create boot.bin with this command after navigating
   to exaples dir, " nasm boot.asm -f bin -o boot.bin"

   if you dont have nasm just skip this step becuase there is already boot.bin to use
 
2. open CMD as admin, nav to examples dir, type this command
to compile kernel.br to raw binary file " bedrockco.exe kernel.br --format bin"

3. create padding file to fill the rest of the kernel file with blank to make its size 512 byte exactly
by typing this command "fsutil file createnew padding.bin (size of kernel.bin - 512)"

or

use the standard padding.bin its already done.


4. merge them as img file by " copy /b boot.bin + kernel.bin + padding.bin BedRockOS.img "

then run on any VM
i recommend you to use Qemu vm "its easy"
jst use this command in cmd in the same dir
( "C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -drive format=raw,file=BedRockOS.img )
